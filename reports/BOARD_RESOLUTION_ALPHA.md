# Board Resolution: Project Alpha (2026-02-06)

**Attendees:**
*   **Owner**: The Chairman
*   **GM**: General Manager
*   **HC**: Bill Belichick
*   **Architect**: Andrew Smith

## Agenda: Impact of "High Cap" Feature Store Upgrade

### 1. The "High Cap" Finding
**Architect**: "Sir, the previous data gaps were statistical noise. When we isolate your significant investments (>$10M Cap Hit), the Risk Engine predicts efficiency with **91% Accuracy (R2=0.91)**."

**Owner**: "You're telling me the machine works perfectly on the players I actually write checks for?"

**Architect**: "Yes. It fails only on the minimum wage roster fillers."

### 2. The Owner's Directive ("The Red List")
**Owner**: "I don't care about the turnover on the practice squad. I care about the $200M payroll. If you can predict efficiency that well, I want to know one thing:"

> **"Who are we paying like a Star who is playing like a Rookie?"**

**Decision**:
*   **Authorized**: The "Middle Class Squeeze" Analysis (GM's Request).
*   **Mandate**: Produce a **"Red List"** of current liabilities.
*   **Constraint**: "Make it readable. I don't want spreadsheets. I want a hit list." (Chart Pop).

### 3. The GM's Execution Plan
**GM**: "I will filter the roster for players with Cap Hits > $10M where our model projects a significant efficiency deficit (`edce_risk` > 0.5 or `fair_market_value` < `cap_hit`). These are our trade/cut candidates."

### 4. Belichick's Input
**HC**: "If they aren't doing their job, get them out of my locker room. I don't care what they cost you."

## Action Items
1.  **Execute "Middle Class Squeeze" Audit**: Identify >$10M players with negative ROI.
2.  **Generate "The Red List" Report**: High-visibility output for the Board.
