# Board Resolution: Confirmation of Structural Alpha

**Date:** Feb 5, 2026
**Subject:** Validation of "Cap Alpha Protocol" Designation

## Executive Summary
The Board has reviewed the quantitative audit of the "Dead Money Engine" and unanimously agrees that the system has transcended detailed auditing to discover **Structural Alpha** (a persistent, exploitable edge in the market).

Accordingly, the Board authorizes the immediate rebranding to **Cap Alpha Protocol**.

## 1. The Alpha Signal (Validated)

### The Owner's View: "Undervaluation Alpha"
*   **Finding:** The "Dynasty Quadrant" identifies franchises (KC, SF, DET) where Brand Value exceeds Win % implies.
*   **The Edge:** We can predict which teams are "Asset Rich" before the market reprices them.
*   **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** "This isn't an audit. It's an investment thesis."

### The General Manager's View: "Efficiency Alpha"
*   **Finding:** The "Discipline Tax" (Penalty Yards + Dead Cap) correlates to Win % with $R^2 > 0.8$.
*   **The Edge:** Removing "Toxic Debt" is the cheapest way to buy wins. It is easier to cut a undisciplined player than to find a Mahomes.
*   **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** "We found free wins in the spreadsheet."

### The Quantitative View: "Predictive Alpha"
*   **Finding:** The "Risk Surface" predicts cap casualties 24 months in advance.
*   **The Edge:** We are not reacting to cuts; we are *shorting* player futures.
*   **Verdict:** **CONFIRMED.** "The signal-to-noise ratio is institutional grade."
