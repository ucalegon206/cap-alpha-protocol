# Strategic Identity Package: From "Audit" to "Advantage"

## 🚨 The Brand Crisis
**Current Name:** "NFL Dead Money Engine"
**The Problem:** 
*   **Negative Priming:** "Dead Money" implies loss, failure, and cleaning up a mess. It positions you as a janitor, not an architect.
*   **Commodity Language:** "Engine" is generic. "Audit" sounds defensive.
*   **Reaction:** Owners don't want to hear about what they lost. They want to hear about what they can *leverage*.

## 🚀 The Pivot: "Capital Velocity"
We are rebranding this system to focus on **Efficiency**, **Liquidity**, and **Competitive Advantage**.

### Core Value Proposition
*   **Old:** "We calculate how much cap space you wasted on cut players."
*   **New:** "We quantify the liquidity friction preventing you from signing a Super Bowl roster."

## 🏆 New Identity Options

### Option A: The "Fintech" Frame (Recommended)
**Name:** **The Cap Alpha Protocol**
**Tagline:** "Quantifying the Invisible Cost of Winning."
**Vibe:** Hedge Fund, Proprietary Trading, Institutional Grade.
**Why it works:** "Alpha" is the holy grail of finance—returns in excess of the market. It implies you found a secret edge.

### Option B: The "Dynasty" Frame
**Name:** **Dynasty OS**
**Tagline:** "The Operating System for Sustainable Dominance."
**Vibe:** Silicon Valley x NFL Front Office. Modern, Sleek, Essential.
**Why it works:** It appeals to the Owner's ego. Everyone wants a dynasty.

### Option C: The "Velocity" Frame
**Name:** **Velocity Zero**
**Tagline:** "Eliminating Friction in the Salary Cap."
**Vibe:** High Performance, Racing, Engineering Precision.
**Why it works:** "Velocity" implies speed and direction. "Dead money" slows you down; this system speeds you up.
