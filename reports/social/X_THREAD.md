The NFL is a $20B asset class managed like a 1980s grocery store. 🛒
I built a Quant Engine to audit the last 15 years of football (2011-2025).
The results?
Your favorite team isn't "unlucky." They are mathematically insolvent. 🧵👇

First, let's talk **Brand Equity**.
We mapped "Wins" vs "Market Power."
*   **Green:** DYNASTIES (KC, SF, DET).
*   **Red:** DISTRESSED ASSETS (CAR, NYG).
If you're in the Red, you don't need a new QB. You need a liquidation event.

We created a metric called the **"Discipline Tax."**
It prices the hidden cost of penalties.
Riley Moss (DEN) gave up 203 yards.
In our model, that's a **-$20.3M** hit to the franchise's Field Equity.
He successfully deleted his own salary 10x over.

"But Coach, he's aggressive!"
No. He's an inefficient asset.
My algorithm flagged this labeled as **"Volatility Drag."**
A modern GM shouldn't pay for volatility. They should short it.

The Flip Side: **"Commercial Alpha."**
Jayden Daniels (WAS) isn't just a QB. He's a dividend stock.
His brand lift + rookie contract = The most efficient asset in sports.
Washington basically *gets paid* to have him on the roster.

How did we build this?
*   **DuckDB** (for the 41k+ row heavy lifting)
*   **Python/Polars** (for the speed)
*   **XGBoost** (Risk Modeling, R²=0.87)
No spreadsheets. No "gut feelings." Just code.

The "Legacy Trap."
Look at the Cowboys (DAL). ⭐️
High Brand Value. Mediocre Wins.
In finance, we call this a "Value Trap."
They extract cash from fans but deliver zero yield (Wins) to stakeholders.

What does this mean for 2026?
The teams that win won't just draft better.
They will have **Staff Production Engineers** running risk models on Sunday morning.
The "Headset" needs a direct line to the "Cloud."
