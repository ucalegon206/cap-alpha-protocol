# Guerrilla Launch Plan (Budget: $200)
**Objective:** Reach Hiring Managers & NFL Personnel.
**Constraint:** $200 Total Spend.
**Strategy:** Asymmetric Impact ("Do things that don't scale").

---

## 1. The Strategy: "Pattern Interrupt"
We cannot out-spend competitors. We must out-weird them.
NFL GMs and Tech Hiring Managers see 1,000 "Resumes" and "Portfolios."
They see **Zero** physical dossiers or "Orbital Sunrises".
