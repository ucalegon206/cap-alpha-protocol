# Competitive Landscape: The Cap Alpha Advantage

## 1. The Contenders

### A. Spotrac
- **Positioning**: "The Encyclopedia".
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive data, contract breakdowns, reliable history.
- **Weaknesses**: Static tables, ad-heavy, no predictive capability.
- **Aesthetic**: "Spreadsheet on the Web". Functional but cluttered.
- **Cap Alpha Ladder**: We are **Actionable Intelligence**. We don't just show the contract; we show the *efficiency* of the contract.

### B. OverTheCap (OTC)
- **Positioning**: "The Analyst's Toolkit".
- **Strengths**: Calculator tools, visually clean, expert commentary (Jason Fitzgerald).
- **Weaknesses**: Basic visuals, limited "What-If" simulation depth (simple cut/trade toggles).
- **Aesthetic**: "Clean Blog".
- **Cap Alpha Ladder**: We are **Enterprise Grade**. We offer "Monte Carlo Trade Simulation" vs their "Simple Calculator".

### C. Pro Football Focus (PFF)
- **Positioning**: "The Grade".
- **Strengths**: Player performance grades, proprietary metrics.
- **Weaknesses**: Cap analysis is secondary. Premium "Consumer" focus vs "Front Office" deep tools.
- **Aesthetic**: "Sports Illustrated". Media-first.
- **Cap Alpha Ladder**: We merge **Financials + Performance**. We tell the *value* story, not just the *grade* story.

## 2. The Gap: "The Bloomberg Terminal for GMs"
There is no tool that combines:
1.  **Deep Financials** (Spotrac/OTC)
2.  **Advanced Performance Metrics** (PFF/DVOA)
3.  **Predictive Machine Learning** (Cap Alpha Exclusive)
4.  **Real-Time Scenario Simulation** (Cap Alpha Exclusive)

## 3. Product Positioning
Cap Alpha is not for fans. It is for **Decision Makers**.
- **Spotrac** is where you go to *check* a salary.
- **Cap Alpha** is where you go to *build* a dynasty.
