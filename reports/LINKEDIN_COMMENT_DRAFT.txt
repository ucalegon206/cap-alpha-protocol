**Comment Text:**

"Detailed Technical Breakdown for the network:

Similar to our work on 'Capital Efficiency' infrastructure at Meta, this pipeline treats the NFL Salary Cap not as a budget, but as a hard-constraint optimization problem.

I prioritized **idempotency** (DuckDB) and **interpretability** (SHAP) over black-box complexity because—as we know—if you can't explain the variance to a VP, the model doesn't ship.

Would love thoughts from the crew on the 'Discipline Tax' findings!
