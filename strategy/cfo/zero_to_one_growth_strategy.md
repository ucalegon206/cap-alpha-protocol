# Strategic Roadmap: The "0 to 1" Growth Engine

**Prepared by:** Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  
**Status:** EXECUTION PHASE  
**Objective:** Generate the first dollar of revenue from Cap Alpha Protocol while maintaining the primary job search momentum.

## 1. The "Dollar One" Hypothesis
In a "zero income" environment, we do not build for "Scale"; we build for **High-Value Individual Transactions**. Our first dollar will likely come from a **Professional Audit** or **Expert Consultation** rather than a subscription SaaS.

### Target Revenue Source: The "Audit-as-a-Service"
*   **Product:** A 5-page "Franchise Liquidity Audit" for a specific NFL team (e.g., Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals).
*   **Buyer:** Media Outlets (The Athletic, PFF) looking for proprietary depth, or Betting Syndicates looking for "Structural Alpha."
*   **Price Point:** $500 - $2,500 per bespoke report.

## 2. Immediate Tactical Moves (Next 14 Days)

### A. The "LinkedIn Signal" (Low Friction)
*   **Action:** Publish the "Discipline Frontier" visualization as a standalone "Alpha Drop."
*   **Goal:** Attract "Inbound DM" inquiry from professional stakeholders.
*   **CFO Logic:** Zero cost to distribute; high reputational ROI.

### B. The "Expert Network" Bridge
*   **Action:** Apply/Update profiles on **Guidepoint** and **GLG** specifically citing "NFL Salary Cap Quantitative Analyst."
*   **Goal:** Secure a $300/hr consultation call.
*   **Status:** High-probability "Dollar One" path for domain experts.

### C. The "Data Annotation" Hedge
*   **Action:** Maximize **DataAnnotation.tech** hours (if available) to provide immediate cash flow ($40/hr).
*   **CFO Logic:** This isn't "Growth," it's **Runway Engineering**. Every $1,000 earned here is 1 month of "Financial Air" for the project.

## 3. Productization of the Engine

| Product Tier | Value Proposition | Pricing Model | Effort |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1: Bespoke Audit** | Deep dive into a team's "Toxic Debt" & Trade Scenarios. | $1,500 / Report | High (4-6 Hours) |
| **Tier 2: Premium Signal** | Weekly API feed of the "EDCE Risk Score." | $500 / Month | Low (Automated) |
| **Tier 3: Public Branding** | High-level LinkedIn charts & "Winning" narratives. | $0 (Lead Gen) | Medium (2 Hours) |

---

## 4. Runway Preservation (Expense Audit)
The CFO mandates a strict "Zero Waste" policy on infra:
*   **Vercel/Cloud:** Stick to Free/Hobby tiers.
*   **Data Lake:** Keep logic in local DuckDB; avoid expensive managed warehouse costs unless subsidized by MotherDuck.
*   **API Usage:** Use "Scraping" (General Counsel approved) over paid API feeds (Sportradar/Genius) until Tier 1 revenue is secured.

## 5. Success Metrics (The CFO Scorecard)
1.  **Metric 1:** Number of inbound "Inquiries" from LinkedIn signal.
2.  **Metric 2:** Completion of the first "Professional Audit" product.
3.  **Metric 3:** Total "Survival Income" generated vs. Monthly Burn.

**Conclusion:** We are currently in "Survival Mode." The goal is to move to "Strategic Alpha" by the end of Q1 2026.
