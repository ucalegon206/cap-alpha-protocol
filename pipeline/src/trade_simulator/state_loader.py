Trade Simulator: State Loader (DuckDB Integration)
Author: Cap Alpha Protocol

Objective: Hydrate the 'LeagueState' from the production DuckDB.
Logic:
1. TeamState: 
   - Cap Space = $255M (2025 Cap) - SUM(Cap Hit)
   - Roster Value = SUM(AV)
   - Needs = 1.0 - (TeamPosVal / LeagueAvgPosVal)
2. Market Players:
   - All active players with contracts in 2025.
