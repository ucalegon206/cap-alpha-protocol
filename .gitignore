# But wait, user said "fetch all logos". If they are large, ignore. 
# I will ignore data_raw generally but maybe keep logos if small.
# Given the user context "portfolio", usually we don't commit 100MB of data.

# Actually we want the frames? If we want the viewer to work on GitHub pages, we need them.
# There are 30 small SVGs. Safe to commit.
