Trade Simulator: Agent Logic (Adversarial Utility)
Author: Cap Alpha Protocol

This module defines the 'Agent' (Team Persona).
Teams maximize different metrics based on their lifecycle phase:
1. CONTENDER: Maximize Win Probability (Willing to sacrifice Cap).
2. REBUILDER: Maximize Draft Capital + Cap Space (Willing to trade Wins).
3. MIDDLE: Balanced approach.
